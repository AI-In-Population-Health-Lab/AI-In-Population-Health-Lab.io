                        We are pleased to announce that Yuelyu Ji will be returning to our lab this fall term as she has
                        accepted the offer of a doctoral program in Information Science at the School of Computing and
                        Information, University of Pittsburgh. Yuelyu had previously worked on a project to predict
                        COVID-19 readmission rates and has a keen research interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). </br></br>
                        We are excited to welcome Yuelyu back to our lab and believe that her expertise in machine learning,
                        NLP, and healthcare research will be a valuable asset to our team. We are looking forward to her
                        contributions in advancing our ongoing projects and collaborations in the machine learning domain.</br></br>
                        Please join us in congratulating Yuelyu on her doctoral program offer and welcoming her back to our lab.</br></br>

                     <p>
                        AIPH is excited to announce the addition of three new members this fall: Wentao Wu, Shengwen Ding and John Song. </br></br>
                        Wentao recently completed his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of
                        Pittsburgh and will be pursuing his Master's degree this fall. With a strong background in computer
                        science, Wentao will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to our lab.   Shengwen, a first-year
                        student in the Master program of Information Science, brings with her experience conducting several
                        machine learning research projects during her undergraduate studies. John, a second-year student
                        in the Master's program in Information Science, has a background in both Computer Science and Engineering. </br></br>
                        With strong passions for research and solid foundations, we believe that they three will make
                        significant contributions to our lab. We are thrilled to welcome these three talented individuals
                        to our lab and look forward to the valuable insights and expertise they will bring to our research endeavors.</br></br>
