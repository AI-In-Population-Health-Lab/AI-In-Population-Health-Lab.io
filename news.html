                        AIPH is proud to announce that one of our members, Yuhe, has taken a position as a Data Scientist at the Department of Biomedical and Informatics (DBMI) at the University of Pittsburgh. </br></br>
                        Yuhe has been an integral member of our lab since her second year of her master's program, and her talented work has been recognized by the DBMI. After completing all the necessary on-boarding procedures, 
                        Yuhe has officially started her new role at the DBMI this week.
                        Yuhe will continue to work with the AIPH and contribute to various DBMI projects as well. </br></br>
                        We look forward to seeing her continued success and are excited to maintain our connection with the department. AIPH wishes Yuhe all the best in her new position and congratulates her on this well-deserved opportunity. </br></br>

                        We are excited to announce the publication of our study, <a href= "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.115085">"Industry, occupation, and exposure history of mesothelioma patients 
                        in the U.S. National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank, 2006–2022"</a> in Environment Research. 
                        This groundbreaking study was conducted in partnership with CDC NIOSH and sheds light on the industry, occupation, 
                        and exposure history of mesothelioma patients in the United States. </br></br>
                        The study is based on data from the U.S. National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank and includes information on more 
                        than 3,000 mesothelioma patients from across the country. The findings reveal mesothelioma patients' history of occupational 
                        exposure, prevalent work in different groups (sex and age), and survival features.</br></br>
                        The publication of this study is a significant achievement for our research team, and we congratulate them on 
                        their hard work and dedication. The findings of this study will undoubtedly have a positive impact on public health and safety, 
                        and we look forward to seeing how they will be used to inform future policies and practices.</br></br>

                        AIPH is excited to announce the addition of three new members this fall: Wentao Wu, Shengwen Ding and John Song. </br></br>
                        Wentao recently completed his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of
                        Pittsburgh and will be pursuing his Master's degree this fall. With a strong background in computer
                        science, Wentao will bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to our lab.   Shengwen, a first-year
                        student in the Master program of Information Science, brings with her experience conducting several
                        machine learning research projects during her undergraduate studies. John, a second-year student
                        in the Master's program in Information Science, has a background in both Computer Science and Engineering. </br></br>
                        With strong passions for research and solid foundations, we believe that they three will make
                        significant contributions to our lab. We are thrilled to welcome these three talented individuals
                        to our lab and look forward to the valuable insights and expertise they will bring to our research endeavors.</br></br>
